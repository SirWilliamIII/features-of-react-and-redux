### Not sure where to begin installing dependencies for a React app?

##### Clone or download the .zip file, rename the project (in package.json as well), npm install and you're done.

###### scripts include:
 * npm start
      - with a pre-start that activates linter in eslint watch mode  
 * npm run lint
      - which checks for errors using eslint
 * npm run lint:watch
      - runs lint script passing watch flag to eslint-watch
 * npm run test
 	  - run your mocha tests from /src/index.test.js
